# Machobot
A bot I've made for Discord.

# Setup
* To allow Macho to join your server, authorize him [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize/?permissions=8&scope=bot&client_id=399794061059424257).
* The default prefix is `m!`. To view info for all of the commands, type `m!help`.
* Now you want to optionally create a `suggestions` channel for the `suggest` command. Allow members to view messages/message history.
* Now, optionally create a `machobot-audit` channel, and make it visible to admins or something.
* You're ready to use Macho!
